# Huawei AI Internship - Project Showcase

## Overview
During my internship at Huawei AI, I worked on multiple impactful projects that involved deep learning, time series forecasting, and regression techniques. Below is a summary of the key projects:

## Projects

### 1. CIFAR Data Classification using ResNet & Fine-Tuning(PyTorch)
- **Objective:** Classify CIFAR dataset images accurately.
- **Approach:**
  - Used **ResNet** for feature extraction.
  - Applied **fine-tuning** techniques to improve model performance.
- **Outcome:** Achieved high classification accuracy by optimizing hyperparameters and tuning the model effectively.

### 2. Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression (Time Series)(TensorFlow)
- **Objective:** Predict stock prices using historical data.
- **Approach:**
  - Implemented **Linear Regression (LS)** for time series forecasting.
  - Experimented with different **window sizes** to optimize predictions.
  - Reduced **overfitting** through proper regularization.
- **Outcome:** Improved forecasting accuracy while maintaining model generalization.

### 3. Backpack Price Prediction - Overfitting Mitigation with Feature Cross & Voting Regression
- **Objective:** Predict backpack prices while minimizing overfitting.
- **Approach:**
  - Used **feature cross** to capture complex relationships in data.
  - Implemented **Voting Regression** combining three models.
  - Models exhibited **high variance in error**, leading to better generalization.
- **Outcome:**
  - **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):**
    - **Training:** 38.86
    - **Testing:** 38.91
  - Demonstrated strong model performance with minimal overfitting.

## Conclusion
Through these projects, I gained valuable experience in model fine-tuning, time series forecasting, and overfitting reduction techniques. This internship allowed me to explore advanced machine learning methodologies and apply them to real-world scenarios.
